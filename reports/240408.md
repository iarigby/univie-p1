# Ia Mgvdliashvili Praktikum 1 Report
## 1. 25 March - April 7

#### Summary
- started reading docs on `kubernetes.io`
- started setting up the master node 
	- installed dependencies
	- initialised the cluster
	- set up Flannel as container network interface
#### Details
Kubernetes documentation reading is going slow because it assumes a lot of background knowledge on many topics, so I am trying to catch up as much as I can. 

I documented the steps I am taking in the command line (and some troubleshooting)  in [logs](https://github.com/iarigby/univie-p1/blob/main/logs.md). I had some trouble setting up Flannel because the `kubadm` uses a different default range for pod network `cidr`. I tried changing that value for Flannel but it wouldn't work, and after destroying and reinitializing the cluster a few times, I just created it with the value Flannel expects.

#### Next steps
- Join from a different node (also on a vps). 
  Since I get easily confused by error messages right now, I decided to first try to join from a vps node and after that join from a home node. This way it will be more straightforward to troubleshoot issues with something basic not set up (vs something separate-network related not set up)
- try create a hello-node deployment from the [official tutorial](https://github.com/iarigby/univie-p1/blob/main/logs.md)
