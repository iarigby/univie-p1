  
- I added the [notes](./network) on cloudflare tunnel attempt and the vpn setup
- I updated a few parameters in the [install](./node_setup) script:
	- new network addresses
	- add swap off that my home server needs (probably overlooked it during Ubuntu Server installation)
	- add steps for wireguard
- I am again stuck on flannel not being able to set up, I updated the config to match wireguard net but maybe something else is needed, I have not done troubleshooting yet but the screenshot and configuration is [here](./flannel_0513.md).
