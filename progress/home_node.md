# Home Node

I need to connect a machine from a residential building. 

##### 1. Fixed IP
The most straightforward solution is getting a fixed ip and port forwarding from isp, but exposing my home network is something I would avoid unless there are no other alternatives.

##### 2. Tunnel or Relay vps
The next easy option seems to be using a Cloudflare tunnel. I am not sure though if this will be sufficient, but I will try over the weekend.

##### 3. VPN
Third option is to create a virtual private network and connect nodes to it (I guess all of them). I feel like this will not be a straightforward thing for me to do given my skills in linux networking. I would gladly learn this in the future but right now it would be best if I can get 2. working easily

Do you think this reasoning is ok? Are there any other possibilities I missed out?
