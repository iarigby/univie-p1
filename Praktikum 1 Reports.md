### 1. 25 March - April 7
Summary
- started setting up the master node
	- installed dependencies
	- initialised the cluster
	- set up Flannel as container network interface



Next step is to join from a different node (also on a vps). To avoid extra complications, I decided to first try to join from a vps node and after that join from a home node. This way it will be easier to see (and debug) differences.
